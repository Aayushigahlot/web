<h1>BROWSERS</h1>
<p>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. Each individual web page, image, and video is identified by a distinct URL, enabling browsers to retrieve and display them on the user's device.

A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.[1] For a user, a search engine is just a website, such as google.com, that stores searchable data about other websites. But in order to connect to and display websites on their device, a user needs to have a web browser installed.

The most popular web browsers are Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge.</p>
